## Why Livestack?

We believe the future of AI is not just about passive chatbots. It's about realtime AI applications that are always on, always listening, always ready to help.

At present, however, to implement such an AI project is still a complex task. Existing AI frameworks aren't well-suited for realtime interaction and often require extensive program design and coding. Once it's prototyped, there are still many steps to take to scale and deploy the application before it can be used by others.

Livestack, designed from the ground up, aims to democratize this process, making it approachable not just for seasoned developers but also for those with basic coding experience, and eventually, for everyone.

We look forward to seeing your next idea come to life with Livestack!

## Design Principles

- Simplicity triumphs over complexity: reduce user's cognitive load as much as possible.
- Reasonable defaults to reduce burden of configuration.
- Minimal surprises and gotchas.
- Introduce new concepts and abstractions only when absolutely necessary.
- Battle-test a new feature, hurt it plenty, before releasing it.
